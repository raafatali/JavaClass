* create 1 constructor with 1 parameter and print This is parent with 1 parameter
* create 1 constructor with 2 parameter and print This is parent with 2 parameter
*
* then create a child class called ChildSuper
*
* in child class create 1 constructor with 1 parameter and print this is from child with 1 paramater
* in child class create 1 constructor with 2 parameter and print this is from child with 2 paramater
* and in this i want you to find which super to use for the following
*
* i want you to create a main method in ChildSuper
* if i type in 2 parameters with calling the ChildSuper class in my main
* i want both
* constructor with 2 parameter from parent
* constructor with 2 parameter from child
* to appear
*
* same vice versa if you call the constructor from child with one parameter, i want the
* one parameter to appear from parent
*
* Hint, i should only see one instantiation of ChildSuper with 2 paramters
*  And, i should only see one instantiation of ChildSuper with 1 parameter
